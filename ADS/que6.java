/*Explanation:
This solution uses a simple for loop to find the largest integer i such that i * i is less than or equal to x.
It iterates starting from 1 and keeps updating result until the square of i exceeds x.
The function returns the largest integer that, when squared, does not exceed x.
Test Cases:
Input: x = 16

Output: 4 (because 4 * 4 = 16)
Input: x = 27

Output: 5 (because 5 * 5 = 25, which is the largest square â‰¤ 27)
This method is simple and easy to understand, making it a good choice for smaller values of x.
