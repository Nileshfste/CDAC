/*Start and Input: The process starts with the user providing input, which is stored as a string.
Convert to Char Array: The string is converted into a character array so that each character can be accessed individually.
Outer Loop: The outer loop (index i) iterates over every character in the array.
Inner Loop: For each character, the inner loop (index j) checks the remaining characters after the current character for duplicates.
Check for Duplicates: If a duplicate is found (i.e., ch[i] == ch[j]), the character is printed.
End: The process repeats until all characters are checked, and then the program ends
